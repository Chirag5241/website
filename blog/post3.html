                    <p>Translating plans into physical movement requires sophisticated control:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Model Predictive Control</strong>: Anticipating future states to optimize current actions</li>
                        <li><strong>Adaptive Control</strong>: Adjusting parameters based on changing conditions</li>
                        <li><strong>Robust Control</strong>: Maintaining stability despite uncertainties</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>My Research Contributions</h2>
                    
                    <p>My own research focuses on several aspects of autonomous navigation:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Texture-Oriented Drivable Area Segmentation</h3>
                    
                    <p>Our work on self-supervised segmentation enables robots to identify navigable surfaces without extensive labeled data. This approach is particularly valuable for indoor robots that must operate in diverse environments.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Vision-Proprioception Fusion</h3>
                    
                    <p>By combining visual information with proprioceptive feedback (how the robot "feels" as it moves), we've developed more robust terrain classification for unmanned ground vehicles. This helps vehicles adapt their control strategies to different surfaces.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Extended Kalman Filters for Underwater Localization</h3>
                    
                    <p>Our comparison of dynamic and kinematic model-driven EKF approaches provides insights for more accurate underwater vehicle localization, addressing the unique challenges of the underwater domain where GPS is unavailable.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    
                    <p>Autonomous navigation stands at an exciting inflection point. The core technologies have matured significantly, and we're beginning to see real-world deployments across multiple domains. While substantial challenges remain, particularly around edge cases, safety validation, and regulatory frameworks, the trajectory is clear.</p>
                    
                    <p>The next decade will likely see autonomous navigation transition from novelty to necessity in many applications. This transition won't be uniform—some domains will advance faster than others—but the cumulative impact on how we move people and goods will be profound.</p>
                    
                    <p>As researchers and engineers in this field, we have the responsibility to develop these systems thoughtfully, prioritizing safety, accessibility, and positive societal impact. The technical challenges are fascinating, but the human and societal dimensions are equally important to address.</p>

                            <p>Fascinating overview! I work in urban planning, and I'm particularly interested in how autonomous navigation might reshape our cities. Have you thought about how reduced parking needs might transform urban spaces? Or how autonomous vehicles might affect public transit systems?</p>

                            <p>I'm curious about your thoughts on the ethical dimensions of autonomous navigation. How do we program these systems to make decisions in unavoidable accident scenarios? And what about the potential job displacement for professional drivers? These social aspects seem just as challenging as the technical ones.</p>
